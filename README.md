**Overview**

This repository includes a collection of RTL design and synthesis examples built using fully open-source tools such as Icarus Verilog (iverilog), Yosys, and GTKWave. All development, simulation, and synthesis tasks are executed inside a cloud-based environment through GitHub Codespaces, eliminating the need for any local installations.

**Features**

Verilog-based RTL design and functional verification

Synthesis using the Yosys open-source toolchain

Simulation using Icarus Verilog

Waveform visualization through GTKWave

Complete cloud workflow using GitHub Codespaces with a noVNC graphical interface

**Cloud Lab Setup**

The project relies on the vsdip/vsd-rtl container environment, enabling seamless access to all required tools in the cloud. This setup ensures smooth, zero-configuration synthesis, simulation, and debugging directly from the Codespaces workspace.
